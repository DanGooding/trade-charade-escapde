PHILIPS_A is more liquid than PHILIPS_B 
PHILIPS_B lags behind PHILIPS_A
hedging on PHILIPS_B
Predict the trend of PHILIPS_B depending on PHILIPS_A




If PHILIPS_A asks go down: 
	wait 0.1s
	if PHILIPS_B asks also goes down: 
		buy the order and increase our lots
		make note of price (X)
		
if PHILIPS_A bid goes up: 
	wait 0.1s
	if PHILIPS_B bids also goes up and price is > X: 
	    sell the order for a profit (use limit)
	    
	    if outstanding limits > 600: 
            cash out the highest bidding order
            
aim to be at 0 position if position >10 or <10

ask - sell
bid - buy


--------------------------------------------

if we wanna calculate offset:

1. calculate latency
2. let A be the instrument which is furthest behind:
	if A.price < B.price:
		buy on A for A's market price, list a sell on A for B's market price
	else:
		sell on A for A's market price, list a buy on A for B's market price
		
keep limit order in less liquid market
withdraw limit order if impossible to make a profit
as soon as limit order filled, put a non-limit offer in other market [risk that someone will take the order before you do]
